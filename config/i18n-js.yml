# Split context in several files.
# By default only one file with all translations is exported and
# no configuration is required. Your settings for asset pipeline
# are automatically recognized.
#
# If you want to split translations into several files or specify
# locale contexts that will be exported, just use this file to do
# so.
#
# If you're going to use the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline, change
# the following configuration to something like this:
#
# translations:
# - file: "app/assets/javascripts/i18n/translations.js"
#
# If you're running an old version, you can use something
# like this:
#
# translations:
# - file: "public/javascripts/translations.js"
# only: "*"
#
translations:
- file: "app/assets/javascripts/i18n/translations.js"
  only: ["*.customers.*", "*.deliverables_by_vehicles.*", "*.deliverable_units.*", "*.destinations.*", "*.errors.mobile.*", "*.order_arrays.*", "*.plannings.*", "*.reporting.*", "*.tags.*", "*.users.*", "*.vehicles.*", "*.zonings.*", "*.all.*", "*.web.*", "*.visits.*", "*.leaflet_draw.*", "*.api_web.*", "*.stores.*", "*.vehicle_usage_sets.import.dialog.*"]
